# A GraphQL-Rail-React simple accounting app - front side

This project aims at building a simple GraphQL API with RubyOnRails. :smile:

Here was the brief:
- You are working on a minimalist accounting software. Your task is to write a small web application that exposes a GraphQL API and allows users to interact with different entities.
- Key features to implement:
  - The user must be able to create a new accounting transaction and to see all the existing ones
  - At any time, we should be able to know what is the current balance of any account
- Characteristics of an accounting transaction: Debit Account, Credit Account, Date, Amount
